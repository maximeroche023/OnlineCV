            <p class="description">Teaming up with my friend, we launched a Shopify website specializing in football jerseys. This venture not only allowed us to gain firsthand experience in e-commerce but also provided valuable insights into digital marketing strategies , particularly on platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram. 
                We delved into creating and managing ads campaigns on these platforms, learning the intricacies of targeting our desired audience and optimizing ad performance. Beyond acquiring customers, we also focused on providing excellent post-sale service, leveraging email communication, mailing lists, and newsletters to foster community engagement and redirect traffic to other businesses.
                Moreover, our journey with the Shopify website provided an opportunity to delve into website design and user experience (UI/UX). We experimented with various changes to the website layout and functionality, learning how to enhance the user journey and optimize conversion rates.
                Due to life shift and divergences of opinions on directions, I've decided to leave the project.</p>

            <p class="description">Working at a Melbourne coffee shop began as a quest to improve my English but transformed into a profound curiosity for Australian culture and consumption habits. Each conversation was an opportunity to enhance my English proficiency. However, as I grew more comfortable, I began to notice the differences between French and Aussie patrons' consumption habits. 
                As my language skills flourished, I became increasingly curious about the business side of the coffee shop. I sought to understand its operations and decision-making processes, igniting a passion for entrepreneurship that continues to drive me today.
                Reflecting on my time as an all-rounder, I realize it was more than just language learning, it was a journey of personal growth and cultural immersion. What began as a quest to improve my English evolved into a deep appreciation for connection and new experiences.</p>
